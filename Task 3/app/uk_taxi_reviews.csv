4,On time and vehicle clean.
4,Punctual and efficient.
4,"I think there was an issue with Taxicode sending incomplete booking details, as the driver wasn't aware we had luggage and I hadbooked an estate car (which his car wasn't). Having said that, the car was very nice and spotless. The driver was early and it was a very pleasant journey."
4,It was good.
4,Wanted to change the time but hard to get through on the number provided. The driver did arrive early though and everything was good with the drive.
4,"Terrible, did not get a confirmation email until and hour before journey, we booked in advanced as was a trip to Garrick for a flight leaving at 3.30 am. needed confirmation way before , called several times on different numbers, no one answered , finally got through and some Indian man who did not understand a word i said answered and could not confirm anything to me. we had to get a family member to drive over at 3 am just in case it didn't arrive. would never use again or recommend to anyone."
4,"An overall positive experience, especially for the punctuality, actually arrived earlier!"
4,Driver was not on time and I had to call. However he did spend time making sure we got to our destination.
4,Driver was a little late as he hadn't allowed sufficient time to find our rural property. He called for directions at the time he should have arrived - if he'd done that 5 minutes earlier then it would have been better.
3,Apparently the traffic was bad which meant we arrived a bit late for our wine tasting tour. Just made us a bit tense before we got there.
3,"Arrived at the airport arrivals at 5:10, taxi arrived at 5:40. Driver was great but I was on my way to the train station having given up. Taxicode do not provide a phone number that works."
3,Driver went longer way and more uncomfortable way than needed to go.
3,"On time, polite but not a great driver, too fast, borderline dangerous."
3,"Friendly driver, however constant Disruption through band radio."
3,"Driver didn’t know where he was going. Bearing in mind the destination was a main railway station, taking wrong turns including a cul-de-sac and also driving in totally the wrong direction wasn’t impressive."
3,Punctual but somewhat anonymous. It would have been better to have received confirmation that the driver was on his way and his ETA. Thank you.
3,Taxi was 10 minutes late but driver very polite and taxi of good standard. Concerning though that the taxi was not marked and there were no signs into outside the taxi which I understood to be requirements. Without confirmation would not feel able to use this service again.
3,Overall journey was good but the driver drove very fast and the streets were very wet.
3,"Stopped outside wrong house, didn’t move so made to walk through mud."
2,Driver said there were issues with traffic lights near to pick up but we didnt see any evidence of this. Late pick up ment that we were two young girls left waiting early hours on our own.
2,Late due to traffic apparently. Nearly crashed head on at one point. Overtook parked vehicle and said he didn't see the oncoming van. Both vehicles had to brake very sharply.
2,The driver did not text me - I had no idea of the drivers details or whether he would even show up. I waited for his for 15 minutes and I was just about to get into another taxi and he called. He was over in departures area in his cab so I had to walk there. Very chaotic. And definitely no meet/ greet.
2,No one confirmed the booking and when the time came the driver wasnt there and the company employee (farhad) asked me to look for another company because they had shortage and that he will refund . Just to mention that the journey was to the airport.
2,We have used your taxi service previously and never experienced any issues. The driver was over 20 minutes late for the pick up (scheduled 07:00am - arrived 07:22am) and we didn't receive any communication the service was running late. The driver was on time for the return pick up at 16:00pm and we received communication for this journey however it did mean Benjamin was late for his event in the morning. 
2,"Taxi driver told me a price for the ride $70 but ended up charging us by time. He went through the busiest roads to make more time and ended charging us $90 plus he asked, no i mean, demanded his tip. If your a turist you better get an uber."
2,"Ordered a black taxi for 530am at 7pm the day before, I was told at 525am there were no cabs in the area.....what a let down!....I got an Uber instead within 3 minutes."
2,"Poor company, never showed for the booked time."
2,"I booked a taxi to go to the airport with DATA Cabs in Sidcup the day before. At the last minute just before when about to leave, I get a call from a man from the same company telling he is the controller, and to tell me that he cannot send the taxi as they have quoted a lower price. Imagine my situation, not knowing how to get to the airport. Never will I book a cab with such an unreliable company ever again who let me down so badly at the last minute. I would not trust them ever again."
2,Worst taxi driver number 67671 picked up at Chalk Farm today at midday. Black electric cab. Driver pretty much doubled the fee to £28 only because he couldn’t stop apparently! I was in a rush and I asked before boarding if he can make the destination. He said yes and then took calls from customers and slowed down to look through storage to answer the lost property throughout the journey. This was unsafe and pure robbery from licensed London taxi company! It’s unfair and greedy! We need to be treated better and stop exploiting customers! Disgraceful! This is why we need UBER. London taxi company does not deserve to serve London. My last taxi trip ever.
1,"Worst company ever, will not use again, they sent me a link to click 15 mins before I wanted to leave and it turned out to be an Uber which I could have booked my self, the link did not work nor no car, we then had to book with a different company. I asked to cancel our return taxi and refund us, I have to apparently email them to ask for a refund and they sent the taxi we cancelled to collect us."
1,Very pleasant drive got to my hospital appointment in time despite rush hour traffic.
1,He didn’t drop us at our destination.
1,"Appalling service. Taxi driver failed to pick me up as he went to the drop off destination 45 mins away! Needless to say, I had to cancel the booking and will never use you again! I would have thought that being able to distinguish between the pick up and drop off destination is pretty fundamental for a taxi firm! I have requested a full refund and can only hope that I will receive this promptly. Fortunately another cab firm were able to come to my rescue otherwise the whole evening would have been a complete disaster!"
1,"There was a complete misunderstanding about the transport. I had booked to go to a show in Eastbourne at 6 p.m. in the evening and ordered the taxi to collect us, with our picnic and picnic chairs at 4.50 and a return journey for after the show at 10. I discussed the details of the trip with the company. A taxi came to my house at 4.50 in the morning, and then another was sent to the Eastbourne site at 10 (presumably), even though no pick up had taken place. Discussion with Mr. Sabry was unhelpful and disappointing. Picnic outings do not usually take place at six in the morning. I have been informed that I should have used the metric system and written 17.50 and 22.00, but surely some common sense could have been expected - particularly after the early monring pic-up did not take place. I called another taxi firm, got a cheaper price and excellent service. However, I am very bitter that I have paid £92.50 to Premier taxis (uk) for nothing."
1,The return journey was cancelled by the company - I rang to make sure it was being replaced by another firm. I was assured that there would be someone coming to collect my client at 16:00. At 15:50 I recieved an email saying that the car was cancelled and there was no replacement. I have two clients stuck in Dormansland who need to get to Brighton. I also had to pay out another £75 for a local taxi service to come to the rescue. Very unhappy with the service!!!
1,"A black cab behind me tried to over take me and hit my car on the side. He left my car with scratches and stop to let me take his details and he also took my details. He seemed fair until the end when he started to twist the facts and say that it wasn't clear who hit who!! He was behind me and I am still wondering how he thought he could turn the facts. I know how to deal with the insurance but he just left me with a big sour taste. I used to think that black cabs in London were the right, fair, nice face of this city but some of them want to destroy this image! It is very sad and frustating."

1,"Taxi number 32304 in Sutton. Pick up from Sutton Station. I arrived in Sutton Station at 11pm. I do take black cab mostly in any occasion instead of others and support them with the current difficult situation of Uber overtaking etc. I mostly pay by card but always tip them... . This taxi driver forgot to switch his micro off... when I asked to pay by card... unfortunately I did hear what he was saying.. before he has realised! I tipped... but probably the last time. Rude, he also informed me how much to tip so he doesn't loose his money! SO BAD. So miserable. Gives a bad name for the black cabs! not helping."
1,"Jumped into a black cab (No. 50912) at Stratford Bus Station. Needed to get to Royal Free Hospital for an appointment. It was 3pmish when I boarded. The journey should take 20-30 mins depending on traffic, the cab took an hour driving all around...I just about made it for my appointment. I didn't leave a gratuitous donation, I figured the unnecessary additional 30mins was more than enough. I'll go with Uber next time."
